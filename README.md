> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Examples

```hcl
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "default" {
  creation_token = "app"
}

module "efs_alarms" {
  source        = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  filesystem_id = "${aws_efs_file_system.default.id}"
}
