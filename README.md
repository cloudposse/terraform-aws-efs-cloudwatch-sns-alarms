> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

> <summary><strong>Watch demo of using Atmos with Terraform</strong></summary>
> <img src="https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/master/docs/demo.gif?raw=true"/><br/>
> <i>Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools"><code>atmos</code></a> to manage infrastructure from our <a href="https://atmos.tools/quick-start/">Quick Start</a> tutorial.</i>

## Examples

```hcl
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "default" {
  creation_token = "app"
}

module "efs_alarms" {
  source        = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-efs-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  filesystem_id = "${aws_efs_file_system.default.id}"
}
